# llamatization
Llamatization, or l11n, is a framework created to adapt LLM prompts for various LLM types. Drawing inspiration from localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) principles, l11n addresses the dual challenge of localizing prompts to individual LLMs and internationalizing them to support multiple languages.
